Documentation Style Guide for Bcfg2
===================================

This is a style guide to use when creating documentation for Bcfg2. It
is meant to be helpful, not a hinderence.

Basics
------

**Bcfg2**

    When referring to project, Bcfg2 is the preferred use of cases.

**Monospace fonts**

    When referring to commands written on the command line use monospace
    fonts.

**Repository**

    When used alone this refers to a Bcfg2 :term:`repository`. When there
    is a chance for confusion, for instance in documents also talking
    about :term:`VCS`, be sure to use the longer Bcfg2 :term:`repository`.

Sections
--------

Unless necessary, all the documentation follows the sections header
rules available at http://docs.python.org/documenting/rest.html#sections.
