Versioning Bcfg2
----------------

#. These are the conventions Bcfg2 has adopted for `versioning`_:

   * The version number will be broken down into Major.Minor.MicroBuild.
   * Major and Minor are ever increasing integers. 
   * Micro is a single digit integer. This is because of limits in some
     of the package systems (specifically Mac OS X).
   * Build is either missing or refers to release candidates: e.g.
     "pre3".
