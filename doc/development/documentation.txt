 Documentation
===============

There are two parts of documentation in the Bcfg2 project:

* The wiki
* The manual


The wiki
========
.. _Wiki: http://bcfg2.org
.. _Trac: http://trac.edgewall.org/
.. _OpenID: https://openid.org/
.. _MCS: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/
.. _Argonne National Laboratory: http://www.anl.gov/

A python-based Trac_ instance is used for the Bcfg2 development
website. The Wiki_ part of the website can be edited after you
have successfully logged in. In order to login, a vaild OpenID
provider is needed. Please request your access to the Wiki_ on the
:ref:`help-mailinglist` or in the :ref:`help-irc`.


The manual
==========
.. _rst: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org
.. _Docutils:

The source for the manual is located in the ``doc/`` directory in the
git repository or in the source tarball. All files are written in
rst_ (ReStructuredText) format. Sphinx_ is used to build the
documentation from the restructured text sources.

Building the Manual
-------------------

* Install the prerequisites.  Docutils_ and Sphinx_ are needed to build.

 * For Debian (Lenny) the tools are available in the `backports
   <http://www.backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructionst>`_
   repository; installation can be done with the following::

    apt-get -t lenny-backports install python-sphinx

 * The needed tools for Fedora based systems are in the `Fedora
   Package Collection <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb>`_;
   installation can be done easily with Yum::

    yum -y install python-sphinx python-docutils

 * Additionally, to build the PDF version:

  * LaTeX
  * pdftex

* Download the source. Please refer to :ref:`source` for more details.

* Build the HTML version by running the following command in the
  top level of the source directory. The output will appear in
  ``build/sphinx/html``::

    python setup.py build_sphinx

* Building the PDF version ::

   python setup.py build_sphinx --builder=latex
   cd build/sphinx/latex
   make

Documentation Style Guide for Bcfg2
===================================

This is a style guide to use when creating documentation for Bcfg2. It
is meant to be helpful, not a hinderence.

Basics
------

**Bcfg2**

    When referring to project, Bcfg2 is the preferred use of cases.

**Monospace fonts**

    When referring to commands written on the command line use
    ``monospace`` fonts.

**Repository**

    When used alone this refers to a Bcfg2 :term:`repository`. When there
    is a chance for confusion, for instance in documents also talking
    about :term:`VCS`, be sure to use the longer Bcfg2 :term:`repository`.

Sections
--------

Unless necessary, all the documentation follows the sections header
rules available at http://docs.python.org/documenting/rest.html#sections.
