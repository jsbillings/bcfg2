.. This is combination of the Ubuntu guide and the Centos guide for
   installing the web reports.

========================
Web Reporting Quickstart
========================

You need to install the bcfg2-web package that is available for your
particular distribution. All packages for Fedora are in the Fedora
Package Collection.

You can find packages for CentOS and RHEL in EPEL_::

    [root@system01 ~]# yum -y install bcfg2-web

The same packages are needed for Debian/Ubuntu systems::

    [root@system01 ~]# aptitude install bcfg2-web

Add Reporting to the plugins line of ``bcfg2.conf``. The resulting
**[server]** section should look something like this::

    [server]
    repository = /var/lib/bcfg2
    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,...,Reporting

    [reporting]
    transport = LocalFilesystem

You then need to initialize the reporting database::

    [root@system01 ~]# bcfg2-admin reports init

Start/restart the Bcfg2 server::

    [root@system01 ~]# /etc/init.d/bcfg2-server restart

Start the Bcfg2 report collector::

    [root@system01 ~]# /etc/init.d/bcfg2-report-collector start

Run the Bcfg2 client in order to populate the statistics database.

Copy server/statistics sections of ``bcfg2.conf`` to
``/etc/bcfg2-web.conf`` (make sure it is world-readable).  You should
then have something like this::

    [server]
    repository = /var/lib/bcfg2
    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,...,Reporting

    [database]
    engine = sqlite3
    # 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'mysql_old', 'sqlite3' or 'ado_mssql'.
    name =
    user =
    # Not used with sqlite3.
    password =
    # Not used with sqlite3.
    host =
    # Not used with sqlite3.
    port =

    [reporting]
    transport = LocalFilesystem

Restart apache and point a browser to your Bcfg2 server.

If using sqlite be sure the sql database file and directory containing
the database are writable to apache.
